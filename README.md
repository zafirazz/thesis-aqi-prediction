# Big Data Solutions for Forecasting Air Pollution ðŸŒ¿

A following repository was created to provide insights and showcase solutions within the thesis framework for the University of Debrecen 2024/2025/2 BSc Computer Science.

## Project Overview

In framework of this study we have also developed a UI to showcase the results and accuracy of each model to forecast air quality (specifically PM10 concentration) using an ensemble of:
- **Tree-based models:** GBDT, DART, LightGBM
- **Sequence models:** LSTM, GRU
- **Traditional approach:** Linear Regression
- **Meta-model:** Neural network that learns from base models' predictions to improve final forecasts.

The pipeline includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Data analysis of AQI and historical meteorological data
- Base models training and evaluation
- Meta-feature construction from base model predictions
- Meta-model training and forecasting
- Exporting results and performance metrics for analysis
- API for each of the base models
